# Prediction-of-Suicide-Ideation-using-machine-learning

Suicide ideation and mental health are serious problems that impact many people globally. For effective prevention and counselling, it is essential to precisely predict these disorders. Machine learning has become an efficient method for detecting mental health issues and suicidal thoughts in recent years. This project explores the use of various machine learning models to predict mental health and suicidal thoughts.

A dataset of mental health surveys and evaluations of suicidal ideation was used to train a variety of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and a Neural Network. The data consisted of responses to a questionnaire on mental health and suicide thoughts.

The outcomes of this study demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can accurately, sensitively, and specifically predict mental health issues and suicidal ideation. The results suggest that these models might be advantageous tools for identifying individuals at risk and offering prompt interventions to prevent suicide ideation.
